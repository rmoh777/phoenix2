## Changes Made

- Fixed inconsistent links between homepage hero button and navigation menu
- Both now point to interview-new.html for a consistent user experience

This PR addresses the issue where changes to the site sometimes reverted to an outdated version of the home page with 'Learn More' button instead of 'Find Lifeline Plans'.

## Testing

- Added documentation for future cleanup steps
